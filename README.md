# Steam Deck Save File Syncer
This tool is designed to make it easier to move save files between a Steam Deck (or any machine really)'s local storage and external (SD card, flash drive, etc.) storage.
This is meant for games that don't use the Steam Cloud and Non-Steam games.

## Setup/Install
The in depth tutorial is a WIP, but here is a overview of the steps required:
1. Boot your Deck into Desktop Mode.
2. Install Java on your Steam Deck.
3. Download this utility to somewhere safe on your Deck.
4. Make a launch script for the utility. A simple Shell Script file will do.
5. Add the launch script as a Non-Steam Game in Steam so it appears in the normal Game Mode interface.

### You'll need to know where the local save files are stored for each game and where you want them stored externally.
